## Survey - Adjust - Forecast - Execute
<hr>
 

As we do our daily jobs, we're under the pressure of trying to please EVERYONE: Everyone we drive and work for, along with the crazy people that put us in extremely dangerous situations while we're working. The main thing to remember is that with everything we have to deal with, we need to ALWAYS be in control of our own actions. When we remember to control our emotions and put SAFETY FIRST, we get home to our loved ones, we earn our paycheck, and at the end of the day we can say, "It's all been worth it!" And everything depends on YOU!

 

## CSA - INSPECTIONS
<hr>
 

There has been an increase in CSA inspections on FedEx Package Delivery Vans in both FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery. The switch in the states' mindset for collecting money has shown the major problem area has been that the driver(s) of the vans haven't been carrying their Medical Card with them while driving the trucks. They have to ALWAYS have the card with them (on their person) while driving. This is a violation against the driver, the contractor, and FedEx. These points are x3 the first year, x2 the second year, and x1 the third year. Drivers: please protect your own license. It's your picture on it, so don't place yourself at risk!

 

## MAINTENANCE
<hr>
 

We, as your contractor, have a very large investment in the truck you drive. It's up to you to notice anything that may need fixed or maintained on that truck to prevent any violations from occurring while you're driving. Look at it like this: It's our truck, but you're driving it for your income. We don't drive it, so we don't know what it needs unless you tell us. No one can read your mind. Communication is of the utmost importance. We would gladly fix the truck before a violation becomes a problem. Please take care of it, because it has to make your pay check every week. If you do a good POST TRIP inspection and report any problems, we have time to fix it before it costs both of us a day's work/pay. Take time to look everything over, check/look at different stuff each time, so you notice anything before a problem arises. SHORT CUTS WILL COST EVERYONE TIME AND MONEY!
