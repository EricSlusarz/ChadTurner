Money! money! money! Everybody needs it and many work just to get money. If you are tired of working a low paying job the Chad Turner Transportation Group would love to talk to you. You could make over $40,000 in your first year as a solo CDL truck driver.

When youâ€™re ready to move up and make more money than you already do, there are plenty of other positions available in the trucking industry. Driving in a team or working as a truck driver trainer could earn you even more money! Team drivers can make $50,000 to $75,000 a year while trainers can make $60,000 to $80,000.

A career in the trucking industry can mean you finally bring home a steady paycheck, receive health benefits, and even get retirement options. There are countless drivers who have driven millions of safe, accident free miles who have made a living hauling goods around the nation. If you are willing to put in the work for this career, it can lead you down many different roads.

We would love to hear from you!
